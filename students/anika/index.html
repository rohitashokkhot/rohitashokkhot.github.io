        <h3>
          1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h3>
        <p id="first-para">
          I noticed a number of visual components that were brought to my
          attention as soon as I opened the website. The occurring motif of
          colour changes caught my attention, along with the lopsided
          distribution of colours, which changed dynamically as I navigated the
          page with my computer mouse. The website felt dynamic and alive to me
          because of this interactive effect, which elevated a basic browsing
          experience to me that was extremely captivating and immersive. I was
          inspired to look into it further and engage with the website more
          because of the colourful aspect that the colours brought.
        </p>

        <h3>
          2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h3>
        I started by placing the computer mouse in the middle of the page and
        watching how the colours changed in response to small movements. I then
        noted the changing colours as I moved the cursor around the page's
        corners in no specific order. Next, I hovered over the bold outlined
        words in the sentence, which drew my attention to textual changes. I
        also noticed that the colours changed from orange to purple, which made
        the experience even more exciting. Finally, I experimented with diagonal
        and vertical mouse movements, further seeing how the interactive parts
        reacted to different computer mouse movements.

        <p id="third-para"></p>
        <h3>
          3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h3>
        I spent the most time interacting with the page’s element of the
        colour-changing feature. While the text colour changed from pink to
        green in sync with the background's changes, the background would
        alternate between four different colours: green, blue, pink, and purple.
        The fluidity of these changes was interesting to watch, as the colour
        distribution changed regularly. Depending on where the computer mouse
        was positioned, the area covered by each colour increased or decreased,
        producing a dynamic and captivating visual effect that promoted constant
        involvement for me as the user.

        <p id="fourth-para"></p>
        <h3>
          4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h3>
        Throughout my two-minute encounter, the most popular activity was moving
        the mouse diagonally and continually moving it over every corner of the
        page to see the distinct and erratic changes in colour distribution. The
        distribution of hues changed with each cursor movement, creating a
        unique visual effect that seemed responsive and natural. This inspired
        me to try more because I was fascinated by how the small changes in
        mouse placement had a significant impact on the page's overall design.
        My attention was maintained throughout the entire thing by the constant
        interaction between colour and movement.

        <p id="fifth-para"></p>
        <h3>
          5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h3>
        By defying common expectations that people may have, the interactive
        experience appears to have the main impression of illustrating the
        boundless creative potential of web design. The website designer Palat
        Tuntaopas's goal is to produce a dynamic, captivating, and immersive
        experience that draws in people to truly explore the website. The idea
        that websites can be more than just informational platforms—they can
        also be artistic and experiential—is reinforced by the design, which
        encourages viewers to actively interact with the page rather than just
        watching and scrolling aimlessly through a page.

        <p id="sixth-para"></p>
        <h3>
          6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h3>
        The dynamic and responsive design aspects of the interactive experience
        effectively convey this primary goal. Users are encouraged to explore
        various parts of the website by the continuously changing colours, which
        change regularly in response to the computer’s cursor movement, creating
        a sense of engagement for the user. The interactive aspect of the
        experience is further enhanced by the way the text changes in sync with
        the background, giving it a fluid and dynamic sense. The website
        effectively blurs the distinction between digital art and user
        interaction by letting users directly change the images, supporting
        Tuntaopas's idea of web design as an innovative and experimental
        medium.Because the website isn't designed to scroll, the user feels
        obligated to browse only on one page and keep moving their mouse pointer
        over it.

        <p id="seventh-para"></p>
        <h3>
          7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
        </h3>
        In my opinion, people should spend two to seven minutes interacting with
        the interactive experience in order to properly enjoy its dynamic
        features. To see how the text changes, they should ideally move their
        mouse pointer around the sentence at least five times, paying attention
        to the bolded words. Additionally, they could explore the entire range
        of colour shifts and interactive effects by dragging the cursor around
        the website's background and corners at least 15–30 times. Their
        experience may be further improved by repeated interactions across
        several visits, since they might pick up on new details or changes in
        the way the design reacts to movement.

        <p id="eighth-para"></p>
        <h3>
          8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h3>
        In order to thoroughly observe and appreciate the shifting visual
        changes in the website, the interactive experience allows viewers to
        engage with it several times at a slow and relaxed pace. Users can
        explore a variety of colour distributions and transitions by slowly
        dragging their mouse across various areas of the page. Because the
        design is responsive, even small motions result in distinctive changes
        to the text and background, which allows the user to conduct lots of
        experimentation. This implies that the experience should be carefully
        examined rather than hurried through, rewarding people who take the time
        to engage with different components and fully appreciate its creative
        design.

        <p id="ninth-para"></p>
        <h3>
          9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h3>
        Similar to interactive installations or motion-responsive graphics, the
        experience makes references to various digital media forms including
        digital art and design, where images are dynamically altered in response
        to user interaction. Additionally, the changing colours and flowing
        interactions are similar to immersive media experiences, which are
        frequently observed in light installations and digital art shows.
        Furthermore, the typography in the website is connected to graphic
        design, in the way that the interaction highlights and changes the text
        through mouse movement.

        <p id="tenth-para"></p>
        <h3>
          10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        I should approach the research experience with curiosity. Instead of
        just looking at the visuals on the website, I am urged to actively
        participate by experimenting with various interactions, evaluating how
        small adjustments made through computer mouse movement impact the visual
        components of the webpage. The typography and graphic design components
        within the website also emphasise the value of paying close attention to
        details, which motivates me to concentrate on the small interactions
        that add to the overall user experience.

        <p id="eleventh-para"></p>
        <h3>
          11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        According to these references, my research experience should create
        feelings of interest, curiosity, and engagement. As fresh colours and
        are revealed with each mouse movement, the dynamic, constantly shifting
        nature of the website graphics creates an emotional response of delight
        and intrigue. This ongoing change keeps the website from being
        monotonous or repetitive, which helped me stay focused and avoid
        boredom. Furthermore, the interactive components foster a sense of
        exploration, elevating the interaction from a passive observation to an
        artistic investigation.

        <p id="twelfth-para"></p>
        <h3>
          12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h3>
        Regardless matter how the user moves their computer mouse, the webpage's
        uneven colour dispersion is the most frustrating aspect of the
        interaction. Because of the way the interactive features reacted to
        cursor movements, some parts of the page consistently stayed uneven,
        regardless of how hard I tried to achieve a balanced or symmetrical
        colour spread. Because the bold outlined words also have an uneven
        colour distribution, this problem is very apparent even when the mouse
        is positioned in the centre of the screen.

        <p id="thirteenth-para"></p>
        <h3>
          13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h3>
        The ability to move the mouse pointer anywhere on the screen and
        continuously observe a dynamic change in colour distribution is the most
        fulfilling aspect of the interaction. Since each movement provides a
        different visual effect, this ongoing transition creates curiosity and
        engagement. Users get a sense of control over the page's changing
        appearance because to the responsive design, which makes the interaction
        feel immersive. Furthermore, each interaction feels new because of the
        element of surprise added by the unpredictable colour shifts. This
        constantly changing aspect of the experience keeps the website from
        being monotonous.
