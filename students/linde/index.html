  <!-- I used the grid box model. For the layout of the website I took inspiration from the researched website. Having a linear page, 
   with several sizes of boxes with both pictures and text. -->

      <h1 class="h1">A1 - Interactive Experience Research Project</h1>
      <h2 class="h2">
        I chose the website Gehry, sculpting harmony. You can find the website
        <a href="https://gehry.getty.edu/">here</a>
      </h2>
      <div class="q1">
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </div>
      <div class="a1">
        When first opening the webpage, it is mostly an orange screen, slowly
        more attributes pop up on the webpage. The first thing I noticed was a
        piece of text that says “click anywhere to enable sound”, this text box
        follows my mouse movement, this makes it hard to miss after when it
        first pops up. The second thing that caught my attention is the moving
        text of “Sculpting harmony”.
      </div>
      <div class="q2">
        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </div>
      <div class="a2">
        <ul>
          <li>Click to enable the sound</li>
          <li>
            Move my cursor among the "sculpting harmony" text to reveal another
            piece of text about the music I just enabled
          </li>
          <li>
            Scrolling down, revealing a 3D render of the concert hall, slowly
            moving closer to the building while keeping scrolling. Several
            angles come into play while scrolling
          </li>
          <li>
            Ends with a top view which transitions into a drawing, still
            scrolling down at this point
          </li>
          <li>Clicking through the videos</li>
          <li>
            Went to explore the model, So I clicked on the text which says
            “explore the model” while exploring there where 2 black dots which I
            hovered my cursor over to reveal a text “explore” which I clicked
          </li>
          <li>
            Held my cursor down and simultaneously move my mouse to change my
            point of view in the model, revealing more black dots.
          </li>
          <li>Clicked on a text box “back to story”</li>
          <li>
            Moved my cursor to the right 1/3 of the screen to reveal a text box
            with “next” to skip some of the videos
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="q3">
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </div>
      <div class="a3">
        I was mostly drawn to the scrolling down to change my point of view on
        the render, It was like I controlled how a video was being played. It
        gave me the power to choose a speed and to also go back, by scrolling
        up. So, I spent the most time engaging with the 3D render shown at the
        beginning of the webpage.
      </div>
      <div class="q4">
        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </div>
      <div class="a4">
        I was mostly scrolling up and down, next to that I spend a lot of time
        moving my cursor to reveal text boxes and clickable options.
      </div>
      <div class="q5">
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </div>
      <div class="a5">
        I believe the primary goal of this experience is to give a preview of
        what it would feel like to visit the concert hall, while educating/
        inspiring the visitor about the creative design process of the concert
        hall. It starts with the 3D render of the place, while an example of the
        music is constantly playing in the background, you are slowly introduced
        to more and more interactive parts of the design process. Allowing you
        to get to know the building, and slowly immerse you in the space. With a
        lot of interactive elements present it feels like an exploration into
        the building (encouraging a visit there) and into the mind of Gehry
        (educating you about the design).
      </div>
      <div class="q6">
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </div>
      <div class="a6">
        It is mainly communicated through the setup of the webpage. It is
        divided into several chapters, explaining several components of the
        design process (education). In each chapter there are models to explore
        and a lot of pictures/ videos showing how attending a concert would look
        like. With videos of the architect, Frank Gehry, talking about the
        process. So, the communication is through webpage structure and mixed
        media interaction.
      </div>
      <div class="q7">
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </div>
      <div class="a7">
        I think this is meant as a linear interaction, meaning that you start at
        the top of the page, and slowly work your way down through the chapters.
        On the visitors own tempo. One could choose to watch all the videos and
        explore all the models in full detail (estimated time 1,5-2 hours), or
        skim through the chapters and take a glance at a little bit of
        everything (estimated time 30 mins). It feels more like a one visit
        webpage due to the linear nature of having to scroll down to the new
        information. On the other hand, all the different interactions encourage
        you to explore. The menu placed on top of the page, makes it easier to
        come back to certain parts for a second/third/fourth/etc. visit. This
        would particularly be of use for Architects (students, workers and
        educators) and classical music enthusiasts/ players.
      </div>
      <div class="q8">
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </div>
      <div class="a8">
        It starts with the prompt “scroll for story”, once you keep scrolling
        down the story, small pieces of text start to show. Such as “explore the
        model”. The letters move, once the cursor hovers above it and a picture
        of the model shows, which indicates you have to click on the text. Once
        you get to the videos, in the bottom middle there is a pause button, and
        an indication of which video you are on. When moving the cursor to the
        left/right third of the screen a text box pops up, showing either
        prev/next, indicating you to click to go to another video. In
        conclusion, the communication about interaction is mainly scroll based,
        text pop ups (visual), labeling and movement of text. When doing a
        repeat visit, the website does not remember where you ended the visit.
        It brings you to the start each time you visit.
      </div>
      <div class="q9">
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </div>
      <div class="a9">
        <ul>
          <li>Sketches (paper and digitalized)</li>
          <li>Architectural models (several materials)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Both in pictures and digitalized to explore</li>
          </ul>
          <li>3D renders</li>
          <li>Video’s</li>
          <li>Photos</li>
          <li>Music</li>
          <li>Anecdotes/ quotes</li>
          <li>Portfolio/ book like setup</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="q10">
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="a10">
        I believe the site acts to mimic an exhibition or portfolio book. Where
        one can wander through the chapters to learn more about the building and
        design process. In the end, the visitor built up knowledge and explored
        the building piece by piece. Going through all the stages of the project
        in a fast comprehensive manner.
      </div>
      <div class="q11">
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </div>
      <div class="a11">
        Due to the explorative nature of the website, I had the feeling of being
        curious about the design/ the process/ the way Gehry works in a project.
        With this also comes the act of being patient, the website requires a
        lot of scrolling and clicking though videos in order to go to the next
        section. This means that if I quickly want an answer to one of my
        questions there is a big possibility I would get a bit frustrated, since
        it is hard to quickly find a specific piece of information. When in an
        adventurous, explorative mindset the website will give you a lot of
        surprises and inspiration for your own projects. There is an accessible
        version of the site, but this took me a while to find.
      </div>
      <div class="q12">
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </div>
      <div class="a12">
        The scroll based linear storyline makes it great for exploration. While
        having a quick look at the website is quite difficult. It takes quite
        some scrolling before you get to the information. Sometimes my laptop
        took a while to skip through the videos (RMIT internet connection),
        making the website not suitable for quick fast interactions, which can
        become annoying when trying to find 1 piece of information. The linear
        story set up is a restricting factor on the website.
      </div>
      <div class="q13">
        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </div>
      <div class="a13">
        I found 2 interactions really satisfying, they were at the start of the
        webpage. The first one being the text flowing in the movement of my
        cursor, revealing a text about music. I started to play a game with
        myself to make the text read as fun/ unusual as possible. It never
        became impossible to read, since the words would not stack on to each
        other (unless following the same path twice), and disappear after a
        certain amount of movement. Which made it not to cluttered. Right after,
        when you first start scrolling down, the video of the 3D render plays
        based on your scrolling movement. The speed of it flows really nice and
        it gives you a great start by seeing the full concert hall from
        different angles. This scrolling/video playing interaction comes back
        several times throughout the chapters. However, the first one really
        catches your attention, the length of each angle is short enough to keep
        it interesting, but long enough to see all the amazing shapes in the
        building. It ends with a smooth transition into the sketch. Which gives
        it a clear ending.
